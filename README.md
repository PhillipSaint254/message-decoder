- A very simple-structured message decoder
- It stores the keys for decoding and it's values in a dictionary
- Seperates the keys from values by spliting each line whenever a space character is found
- It reads a message file with an encoded pyramid-structered numerical message
- It matches the last number in each line of the file to the key-value dictionary to decode the message
